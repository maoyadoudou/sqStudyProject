## Introduction
This project is recode from TDD book Auction project in Part 3 and commits operation are always in the end of chapter.

I was stuck in Chapter 15 for 2 days. In the latter half part of this chapter, changing code seem can't make project works.
I find [raulbirto/my-goos-code](https://github.com/raulbrito/my-goos-code) and [shnny85/goos-book-code](https://github.com/skinny85/goos-book-code) projects, these projects can help TDD beginner, thanks these nice guys
